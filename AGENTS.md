# switchyard

A Rust microgrid simulator with a Lisp-driven config DSL. Reimplementation of
microsim where component physics lives in Rust and Lisp's job
is wiring the topology + animating the environment.

## Layout

- `src/lib.rs` — module roots
- `src/sim/` — components + scheduler
  - `component.rs` — `SimulatedComponent` trait, `ComponentHandle`, `Telemetry`
  - `microgrid_site/` — per-microgrid registry, physics tick, grid state,
    topology (+ `history.rs` sampler, `scenarios.rs` event log)
  - `microgrids.rs` — enterprise registry + per-mg routing
  - `dispatch.rs` — enterprise dispatch store (per-`microgrid_id`, id
    allocator, lifecycle broadcast); backs the dispatch gRPC + UI
  - `bounds.rs` — `VecBounds`, `ComponentBounds` (rated + TTL
    augmentations, `validate_active_setpoint` 0-W-park gate)
  - `ramp.rs` — `CommandDelay` + `Ramp`
  - `decay.rs` — `bounded_exp_decay` + `soc_protected_bounds`, plus
    the SoC lifecycle helpers shared by battery/EV (`SocProtect`,
    `sanitize_soc_pct`, `integrate_soc_pct`)
  - `battery.rs`, `meter.rs`, `grid.rs`, `ev_charger.rs`,
    `inverter/{battery,solar}_inverter.rs`, `steam_boiler.rs`
  - `marker.rs` — no-physics categories (chp, wind turbine, power
    transformer, breaker); they classify the meters around them
  - `site_import.rs` — microgrid API site-export JSON → `(make-* …)` /
    `(connect …)` forms for `/api/microgrids/import`
  - `graph_adapter.rs` — lifts a site into
    `frequenz-microgrid-component-graph` nodes/edges (validation +
    the formula endpoint behind the formula explorer panel)
- `src/lisp/` — config DSL glue
  - `mod.rs` — `Config` (fields, accessors, reload)
  - `boot.rs` — `Config::new`: interpreter setup, defun registration,
    tulisp-async wiring, background loops
  - `defuns/` — every `register_*` installer, one file per topic
    (clock, scenarios, microgrids, metadata, runtime_modes, …)
  - `microgrid_file.rs` — text format for a managed microgrid file
    (generated block + script section); `parse` / `compose` /
    `render_block`
  - `overrides.rs` — structural-eval persist-on-write: regenerates a
    microgrid's managed file, or `enterprise.lisp` for enterprise-wide
    state
  - `undo.rs` — per-microgrid undo stack over the managed-file rewrites
  - `snapshots.rs` — per-mg snapshot save/load under `snapshots/{id}/`
  - `make.rs` — `(make-*)` constructors via `AsPlist!`
  - `handle.rs` — `ComponentHandle` ↔ `Shared<dyn TulispAny>` round trip
- `src/ui/` — embedded web UI server
  - `mod.rs` — axum router + serve entry points
  - `handlers/` — HTTP handlers, one file per topic (topology, eval,
    scenarios, dispatches, …)
  - `state.rs` / `loopback.rs` / `events_ws.rs` — loopback client cache,
    gRPC loopback supervisor, WS event push
- `ui-assets/` — the SPA as hand-rolled ES modules (`app.js` is the
  entry; `topology.js`, `live.js`, `metrics-store.js`,
  `metrics-panel.js`, `inspect.js`, `repl.js`, `routing.js`,
  `dialogs.js`, `editor.js`, … own one concern each;
  `metrics-store.js` holds the derived-stream rings + the PF helpers
  and `metrics-panel.js` the floating charts panel that reads them;
  `live.js` owns the live-overlay pure helpers: label
  text, number formatting, the dead band and edge flow; `pill.js`
  owns the node model and canvas renderer both graph canvases draw
  with, and the zoom tiers (full / hero / marker); `hovercard.js`
  the node hover card (pure model + DOM widget); `side-panel.js` the
  floating-card shell every panel (inspector, formulas, metrics,
  weather, REPL, logs, Defaults, Report) opens in — static-markup
  cards are listed in its `STATIC_PANELS`, per-panel width and spawn
  corner in `PANEL_DEFAULTS`; any card docks into the bottom or right
  strip (`#dock-bottom`, `#dock-right`; `STRIPS` holds each strip's
  ids, axis and sizes; `dockPanel(name, edge)` / `floatPanel` /
  `layoutStrip(edge)`; persisted under `sw-panel-dock-<name>` and
  `sw-strip-<edge>`);
  `splitter.js` the drag-to-resize
  handshake the dock strips use; `strip-model.js` their DOM-free
  arithmetic (shares, order, size clamp); `vendor/fonts/` the
  vendored IBM Plex faces (OFL))
  - Reactive power reads at parity with active power across the SPA:
    the hover card draws a Q envelope bar under the P one (same
    `hovercard.js` `envelopeBar`, labelled in VAr); the metrics
    panel's Reactive power card charts the `grid_reactive_power`,
    `pv_reactive_power` and `battery_reactive_power` aggregate
    streams, with each chip reading out PF against its own P stream
    and an optional dashed PF overlay on a right-hand scale (both
    from `metrics-store.js` `pfValue` / `pfText`); the inspector's
    knob table offers
    `set-reactive-power` on inverters and `set-meter-reactive-power`
    / `set-meter-power-factor` (with a `leading` checkbox) on meters.
- `tools/ui-smoke/` — Playwright smoke scripts against a live server
  (`SW_UI=http://127.0.0.1:PORT node tools/ui-smoke/live-topology.mjs`).
  The `ui-e2e` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the e2e half on
  pushes to main and PRs targeting main; it's also runnable by hand
  the same way. The e2e half drives the Berlin demo (microgrid 2200)
  and expects it in the state dir's `microgrids/`, so run it from a
  scratch state dir:

  ```sh
  SD=$(mktemp -d); mkdir "$SD/microgrids"
  cp examples/berlin-demo.lisp "$SD/microgrids/2200.lisp"
  ./target/debug/switchyard --state-dir "$SD" --ephemeral-ports \
      --emit-endpoints="$SD/endpoints.json" "$SD/microgrids/2200.lisp" &
  until [ -f "$SD/endpoints.json" ]; do sleep 0.2; done
  SW_UI=http://$(jq -r .ui "$SD/endpoints.json") \
      node tools/ui-smoke/live-topology.mjs
  ```
- `src/server.rs` — `Microgrid` gRPC service
- `src/assets_server.rs` — `PlatformAssets` gRPC service (shared port)
- `src/dispatch_server.rs` — `MicrogridDispatchService` gRPC service
  (store-and-serve dispatch API; CRUD + stream over `sim::dispatch`)
- `src/proto.rs` + `src/proto_conv.rs` — proto include + `Telemetry` →
  `MetricSample`s
- `src/timeout_tracker.rs` — request lifetime → `reset_setpoint` expiry
- `src/bin/switchyard.rs` — headless server
- `src/bin/swctl.rs` — clap-based client CLI
- `sim/common.lisp` — Lisp helpers (`every`, `cancel-timers`,
  `reset-state`); embedded into the binary with `defaults.lisp` +
  `scenarios.lisp` as the prelude
- `examples/berlin-demo.lisp` — self-contained demo world: generated
  topology block + a script section with the environment animation
  and the seven starter scenarios. Boot scripts are optional
  (`switchyard [script …]`); a bare boot loads worlds on demand via
  `(load …)` / the Microgrids tab, and `--state-dir` anchors
  `microgrids/`, `enterprise.lisp`, `snapshots/`, and relative paths

## Managed microgrid files

Each microgrid lives in one `.lisp` file: a switchyard-generated
block (`;;; switchyard:generated` … `;;; switchyard:end`) holding a
full `(make-microgrid :id … :name … :grpc-port … :topology (lambda ()
…))` — every component as a flat `%make-*` plus `connect` calls,
rewritten from live state on every structural eval — followed by a
hand-written script section that runs after the structure, in that
microgrid's scope, on every load (scenarios, `set-meter-power`
sources, `every` drivers; never component construction — the
generated block owns structure, and constructing more in the script
section collides with it on the next load).
`microgrid_file::{parse,compose,render_block}` split / rejoin /
derive the two sections. `(set-microgrid-name ID NAME)` and
`(set-microgrid-tso ID TSO)` edit the head's own arguments and
persist like any other structural edit; the `:grpc-port` has no
setter on purpose — a listening gRPC server pins it, so moving one
needs an unload (a later sub-project).

Files load explicitly — `(load "path.lisp")`, a boot-script arg, or
the UI's Load — never implicitly. Loading a second file that declares
an id already owned by a DIFFERENT file is a hard error naming the
owner; re-loading the SAME file re-registers its microgrid in place,
reusing the live site so boot-spawned physics / gRPC survive. A
driver-only script — timers perturbing somebody else's world, no
`(make-microgrid …)` of its own — is watched and hot-reloaded per
file just like any other loaded file, but a *whole-world* reload
(the undo/settings-failure path) only replays files that register a
microgrid; a driver-only script sits out of that replay list.

"Load as N" (`Config::load_as`, `POST /api/load-as`) answers that
collision by copying the managed file to `microgrids/N.lisp` and
re-numbering everything the enterprise makes unique: the head's
`:id` becomes N, `:grpc-port` becomes a free one (the original's is
held by a listening gRPC server), and every component in the
`:topology` lambda gets a fresh `:id` off the enterprise allocator,
with each `(connect a b)` moved to match. Without the component
re-mint a copy of a *populated* live microgrid always fails
("component id X is already registered in microgrid Y") — component
ids are enterprise-unique and a generated block pins every one of
them. Unmanaged files are refused: there is no generated block to
re-number mechanically. Only the generated block is re-numbered —
the hand-written script section is the author's and is copied
verbatim, so any component id it names (a `set-meter-power` source,
an `every` driver) still points at the ORIGINAL's components and
has to be hand-fixed after a load-as.

`enterprise.lisp` carries enterprise-wide state: id, timezone,
request-lifetime bounds, the assets/dispatch socket addresses, and
every `*-defaults` plist. `Config::persist_enterprise` rewrites it
whenever an eval touches enterprise-wide state — same two-section
shape as a microgrid file.

Per-microgrid snapshots live under `snapshots/{mg_id}/{name}.lisp`
(`src/lisp/snapshots.rs`) — a frozen copy of that microgrid's managed
file; loading one writes it back over the live file and reloads just
that microgrid. Undo (`src/lisp/undo.rs`) is per-microgrid too: one
stack per mg id over the managed-file rewrites.

The pre-migration overrides journal and `(load-overrides)` replay are
gone. `load-overrides` survives only as a no-op deprecation shim in
`sim/common.lisp` — a warning for any old, unmigrated file that still
calls it ("this microgrid predates managed files — use Adopt in the
UI").

## Architectural rules

- **Lisp wires + animates the environment, Rust does physics.** Every
  component's tick / ramp / SoC derate is in Rust. Lisp's only verbs are
  `(make-*)` to build the graph and `(every …)` / `(run-with-timer …)` to
  perturb grid state or flip runtime knobs over time.
- **Inverter and battery couple only through the DC bus.** A real inverter
  and battery share an electrical bus, not data. `Battery::set_dc_power`
  clamps to its own SoC-derated bounds and keeps the ratio of accepted to
  pushed power; the inverter publishes its own push scaled by each child's
  `dc_accept_ratio` (zero when tripped or when no healthy child took the
  push), so a clipping battery shows on the inverter and the meters above
  it, and several inverters on one bus share the clip in proportion. The
  API gateway (server.rs) intersects bounds for setpoint validation —
  components never read each other's bounds. Reactive power (Q) terminates
  at the inverter on the DC-bus path — a real DC bus carries no Q, so
  `Battery::dc_power_w` is pure signed active power with no apparent-power
  blend, and only the inverter's own AC-side `PowerAxis` models Q with a
  rated band and augmentations. (A meter's reactive source — below — is a
  separate, simpler VAr/PF value, not a `PowerAxis`.)
- **`PowerAxis` (`src/sim/axis.rs`) is the one control path shared by
  active and reactive power.** Both inverters and the EV charger put P
  on a `PowerAxis` (rated band + TTL augmentations, command-delay, ramp);
  both inverters put Q on a second `PowerAxis` whose static shape comes
  from a `ReactiveCapability` (PF cap, kVA cap, both, or neither)
  evaluated at the OTHER axis's live P instead of a rated pair of its
  own. Both axes re-clamp their armed target to the live envelope every
  tick, so a narrowing bound (a tightening augmentation, or the EV
  charger's SoC derate feeding its axis as a dynamic band) actually
  slews the output down rather than waiting for the next command; a
  battery inverter still clips a narrowing SoC band by scaling the
  published value (`dc_accept_ratio`), not by re-clamping the armed
  target — todo.org d5b keeps that question open. `:reactive-pf-limit`
  sets `k` in `|Q| ≤ k × |P|` — a ratio of apparent quantities, not
  true power factor (cos φ). A meter's own
  reactive source is the real thing: mutually-exclusive `:reactive-power`
  (a VAr constant, lambda, or symbol) or `:power-factor` + `:leading`
  (true cos φ in `(0, 1]`, deriving `Q = P·tan(acos(pf))` off the
  meter's own live P, negated when leading). Like `:power`, a fixed
  numeric reactive source freezes into the persisted managed file; a
  lambda or symbol source doesn't, and leaves the meter unrenderable.
- **Single physics tick, registration order = tick order.** `MicrogridSite::spawn_physics`
  runs one `tokio::time::interval` at `physics_tick_ms` and calls `tick()` on
  every component in registration order. Children register first because Lisp
  evaluates `:successors` before the surrounding `make-*`.
- **Telemetry stream cadence is anchored to a target timestamp.** `next_due +=
  step` then `sleep until next_due`; re-anchor only when behind. Per-stream
  `:stream-jitter-pct` perturbs each step; mean is exactly the configured
  interval.
- **Site weather is one singleton per microgrid, not per-component.**
  `(make-weather …)` installs a parametric clear-sky day (a sunrise/sunset
  window, a sine peaking at `:peak%`) plus an optional ambient cloud
  generator; `(set-weather …)` retunes any of it in place; `(pass-cloud
  DEPTH DURATION &optional RAMP)` scripts one deterministic cloud;
  `(weather-status)` reads the sky back as an alist (`src/lisp/defuns/weather.rs`,
  `src/sim/weather.rs`). A solar inverter with no `:sunlight%` follows the
  site's weather (`:weather-lag-s` / `:weather-jitter-pct` lag and roughen
  the sample it reads — Follow-only; with no explicit lag each inverter
  gets a stable id-derived 0–60 s offset so a cloud sweeps across a
  multi-PV site, and `:weather-lag-s 0` opts out; `:array-peak-w` sizes
  the DC array whichever source the sunlight comes from); passing
  `:sunlight%` explicitly makes it Manual instead, and
  `(clear-solar-sunlight ID)` is the way back to Follow. `GET`/`POST
  /api/weather` mirror the same four doors for the weather panel (day
  curve, live site-% readout, pass-a-cloud trigger), which has no Lisp
  console of its own.

## Build / run / test

```sh
cargo build
cargo test                                # unit tests for bounds/ramp/decay
cargo run --bin switchyard examples/berlin-demo.lisp
cargo run --bin swctl -- info
cargo run --bin swctl -- tree
cargo run --bin swctl -- stream 1001 --samples 5
cargo run --bin swctl -- set-power 1001 5000
```

`ui-assets/` changes: `npx @biomejs/biome check ui-assets` (config in
`biome.json`) — `npx biome` alone resolves to an unrelated no-op
package on the npm registry, not this project's linter, so always
spell out `@biomejs/biome`. Plus five node-only gates that need
neither a browser nor a running server:

```sh
node tools/boot-smoke.mjs        # imports app.js under a DOM shim:
                                 # catches TDZ / cycle / bad-export
                                 # breakage a curl-200 can't see
node tools/formula-ast-test.mjs  # formula-ast.js parser + renderer
node tools/metrics-store-test.mjs  # metrics-store.js ring/PF/format
node tools/weather-panel-test.mjs  # weather-panel.js cloud list vs curve
node tools/panel-dock-test.mjs   # strip-model.js tile shares/order/size
```

UI input convention: a numeric field that commits on Enter (inspector
knobs, weather config fields) must hide the browser's native spinner
arrows (`appearance: textfield` + the `-webkit-*-spin-button` rules in
`style.css`) and ignore wheel scrolling (a non-passive `wheel` listener
calling `preventDefault`, Firefox steps a focused number field on a
wheel) — either affordance changes the value without committing it, and
the next poll or blur silently reverts. Arrow KEYS keep stepping: those
are deliberate keyboard edits, one Enter from a commit. Fields that
commit via a button (dialogs, pass-a-cloud) may keep both.

Each registered microgrid binds its own gRPC port; the first
defaults to `[::1]:8800` and subsequent microgrids step by ten
(`:8810`, `:8820`, …). Override via `:grpc-port` on
`(make-microgrid …)`. swctl's `--addr` points the gRPC client at
the first microgrid by default; pass `--addr http://[::1]:8810`
etc. to reach others. The UI server binds `127.0.0.1:8801` by
default; override the port with `--ui-port N`, or pass
`--ephemeral-ports` to bind the UI and every gRPC / assets / dispatch
listener on OS-chosen ports (parallel CI instances). A routable
`--ui-bind` host is still on the roadmap. Add `--emit-endpoints=PATH`
to write the resolved addresses as one JSON line once bound (the
readiness signal).

`PlatformAssets` and `MicrogridDispatchService` each bind a single
shared listener (they're enterprise-wide, keyed by `microgrid_id` per
request): assets on `[::1]:9900`, dispatch on `[::1]:8900`. Override
via `(set-assets-socket-addr …)` / `(set-dispatch-socket-addr …)`.
Point the dispatch CLI at it with
`--url 'grpc://[::1]:8900?ssl=false' --auth-key any` (auth is ignored),
or use `swctl dispatch {list,create,pause,resume,delete,get}`. The
per-microgrid Dispatches UI sub-tab (`/api/mg/{id}/dispatches`) lists
them and can create / pause / resume / delete; all three write paths
(gRPC, UI, swctl) funnel through `DispatchStore::{create,set_active}`,
so construction + validation stay identical.

## Dependencies

- `tulisp = { version = "0.29", features = ["sync", "etags"] }` — the
  crates.io release (the git main-branch pin ended when 0.29.0
  shipped). Known 0.29.0 gap: a re-entrant `eval_string` underflows
  the eval-depth counter (fixed upstream) — `src/lisp/defuns/fs.rs`
  works around it with `eval_file`; drop the workaround on the next
  release bump.
- `tulisp-async = "0.1"` — same-ctx timer primitives (`run-with-timer`, `cancel-timer`,
  `sleep-for`). `TokioExecutor::new` calls `Handle::current()`, so
  `Config::new` must be invoked inside a running tokio runtime.
  `register` returns a `Handle`; the pre-tick hook owns one clone
  and ticks it each physics step — without that, no timer body
  ever runs (the same-ctx model has no background firing thread).
- Proto roots are vendored under `submodules/`:
  - `submodules/frequenz-api-microgrid` (pinned at v0.18.1) — override
    with `SWITCHYARD_PROTO_ROOT` for a private mirror.
  - `submodules/frequenz-api-assets` (pinned at v0.1.0).
  - `submodules/frequenz-api-dispatch` (pinned at v1.0.0) — dispatch
    v1; imports the same vendored common v1alpha8, so no common of
    its own.

## Adding a component type

1. New file under `src/sim/` implementing `SimulatedComponent`.
2. Add to `src/sim/mod.rs` re-exports.
3. Add a `%make-foo` defun in `src/lisp/make.rs` with `AsPlist!`-derived
   args, calling `site.register(...)`. Note the leading `%` —
   user-facing topology code calls `make-foo`, which dispatches here.
4. Add a `foo-defaults` plist + `(defun make-foo …)` wrapper to
   `sim/defaults.lisp`. The wrapper `apply`s `%make-foo` to the
   defaults plist `append`-ed in front of the caller's args; AsPlist's
   last-occurrence-wins resolution lets per-component plist values
   override the defaults.
5. (Optional) Override `subtype()` if proto needs `InverterType::Foo` / etc.
6. Add the category to `COMPONENT_MAKE_FNS` in
   `src/lisp/microgrid_file.rs` — the closed set "load as N" uses to
   spot a component form. Miss it and a copy keeps the original's
   ids for that type (`every_component_make_fn_is_a_real_constructor`
   guards the entries, but cannot see a type that was never added).
7. Register through `register_with_modes(...)` so the component gets
   the shared config + runtime kwargs: `:operational-mode` (config,
   persisted; derives the runtime knobs) plus `:health` /
   `:telemetry-mode` / `:command-mode` (runtime fault knobs, checked
   against the operational mode).

## Sample-config DSL convention

Two-layer split:
- `%make-*` — Rust primitives in `src/lisp/make.rs`. Pure plist
  parsing; every field arrives as a plist key, no defaults.
- `make-*` — Lisp wrappers in `sim/defaults.lisp` that prepend a
  `<cat>-defaults` plist and dispatch to `%make-*`.

Topology code uses `make-*` (defaults applied). To opt out of
defaults entirely for one call, invoke `%make-*` directly.
Per-component plist args win without any special handling — AsPlist!
takes the last occurrence of each key and the wrapper's defaults
appear first in the merged plist.

The prelude (common / defaults / scenarios) is compiled into the
binary via `include_str!`, so editing `sim/defaults.lisp` needs a
rebuild; a script that wants live defaults-editing can still
`(load "sim/defaults.lisp")` and `(watch-file …)` it explicitly.

## Lisp value adapters

- Runtime mode enums (`Health`, `TelemetryMode`, `CommandMode`) and
  the config-level `OperationalMode` take their lisp-side
  `TryFrom<TulispObject>` + `TulispConvertible` impls in
  `src/lisp/runtime_modes.rs`. **Symbols only** — `:health 'error`
  works, `:health "error"` errors with a type mismatch. Note the
  split: `OperationalMode` is microgrid CONFIG (persists via the
  structural-eval rewrite of the microgrid's managed file, drives the
  formula engine); the other three are runtime fault knobs that
  depend on it.
- `LispValue` (`src/lisp/value.rs`) — passthrough wrapper that lets a
  raw `TulispObject` ride through `AsPlist!` (works around the
  blanket-`From<T> for T` `Infallible` mismatch). Used for `:power`
  and `:sunlight%`, where the make-* dispatcher inspects the raw
  shape to pick between a constant and a `DynamicScalar`.

## Lisp gotchas (current tulisp-vm)

- **Timer bodies run on the calling ctx.** Same-ctx tulisp-async
  funcalls bodies on the parent `TulispContext`, so a lambda's
  lexical captures (`let*`-bound state, the surrounding closure
  environment) are preserved across firings. defuns/defvars/global
  setq results are visible as you'd expect.
- **`(every …)` callbacks fire on `Config`'s dedicated refresh
  loop, not on the physics tick.** `Config::spawn_lisp_refresh_loop`
  ticks on its own 100 ms grid, takes the interpreter lock once
  per pass, refreshes every microgrid's dynamic-scalar inputs,
  then drains the tulisp-async pending-firings mailbox. So a
  `(run-with-timer 0.05 …)` waits up to 100 ms before firing,
  and a zero-delay one fires on the next refresh pass. Tests
  that need a fire without spinning the loop call
  `cfg.refresh_once()` (synchronous wrapper for the same work).
  Physics ticks themselves are pure Rust now — they read the
  atomic scalars the refresh loop has cached and never touch the
  interpreter, so a long `/api/eval` no longer freezes the
  microgrid's beat.

## Adding a runtime knob

1. Field on the component config struct + plist arg in `src/lisp/make.rs`.
2. (If runtime-mutable) trait method override + `MicrogridSite` setter + Lisp defun
   in the matching `src/lisp/defuns/` file. Use `(every …)` or
   `(run-with-timer …)` from the config to script behaviour over time.
3. Demonstrate via a new line in `examples/berlin-demo.lisp` and
   verify via swctl.

## Testing an external bounds-driving app

Switchyard is used to test apps whose job is to push
`AugmentElectricalComponentBounds` and watch `power_bounds` react (a
GCP active-power limiter is the motivating case).

- **Both battery and solar inverters curtail to their effective
  (rated ∩ augmentation) bounds every tick.** `CommandDelay::poll`
  returns the armed setpoint on every tick, and `tick()` re-clamps it
  to the live envelope — so an external app narrowing a bound actually
  slews the inverter down at `ramp_rate`, and it recovers when the
  augmentation relaxes (tests: `late_augmentation_re_clamps_an_armed_setpoint`;
  `solar_inverter::tick`). Curtail-to-bounds already exists — don't
  reimplement it. A controller commands a setpoint **once**; it need
  not re-send, since the armed value persists and keeps curtailing.
- `set_active_setpoint` **hard-errors** a command outside the live
  (augmentation-narrowed) envelope — faithful to the real API gateway
  gating out-of-envelope setpoints. An EMS wanting "max within the cap"
  reads the bounds and commands within them.
- An inverter set to `:health 'error` (or `'standby`) **trips offline
  to zero output** *and* is dropped from the healthy `power_bounds`
  aggregate. A battery inverter clears its setpoint and awaits
  re-dispatch on recovery; a PV inverter resumes from sunlight.
- Drive sim state ad-hoc by POSTing lisp to
  `http://127.0.0.1:8801/api/eval`, e.g.
  `--data "(set-component-health 201 'error)"` → `{"ok":true,…}`.
- Switchyard's physics supports closed-loop bound tests today; the
  remaining gaps are ergonomic, not physical — scenario assertions,
  an in-sim controller/actor that reacts to live bounds, declarative
  signal profiles, and deterministic sim-time. See `todo.org` §I.

## Roadmap and deferred work

See `todo.org` for the forward-looking roadmap (browser-driven UI
tests, additional gRPC services, physics realism upgrades, CI
end-to-end testing) and known open design questions.
