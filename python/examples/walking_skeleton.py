"""Y0 walking skeleton, now with the Python topology builder.

The thinnest end-to-end path: build a topology in Python → launch → read a
formula → assert. Run against a built binary:

    SWITCHYARD_BIN=../target/debug/switchyard python examples/walking_skeleton.py

An existing ``.lisp`` file works too — ``sw.launch("skeleton.lisp")`` or
``sw.launch(sw.Microgrid.from_lisp_file("skeleton.lisp"))``.
