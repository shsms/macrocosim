"""pytest plugin: a ``macrocosim`` fixture that launches and tears down a
Site for each test.

Auto-loaded via the ``pytest11`` entry point once the package is installed.
Provide a ``macrocosim_config`` fixture (a :class:`macrocosim.build.Microgrid`
or a path to a ``.lisp`` file) and depend on ``macrocosim``:

    import macrocosim as mc
    import pytest
    from frequenz.quantities import Power

    @pytest.fixture
    def macrocosim_config():
        return mc.Microgrid(id=1, topology=mc.grid(id=1,
            successors=[mc.meter(id=2, power=7000.0)]))

    async def test_grid_holds(macrocosim):
        await macrocosim.expect.grid_power(
            approx=Power.from_kilowatts(7), tol=Power.from_watts(500))

The ``expect`` assertions are ``async``, so tests that await them must run
under ``pytest-asyncio`` (installed with the ``grpc`` extra) with
``asyncio_mode = "auto"`` in your pyproject/pytest config, or be marked
``@pytest.mark.asyncio`` individually. Without it pytest collects an
``async def`` test but never awaits it — the assertion silently never runs
and the test passes green.

The binary is found via ``MACROCOSIM_BIN`` / ``$PATH`` (or pass one through
a ``macrocosim_bin`` fixture).

The plugin needs pytest 7.4 or newer and pluggy 1.2 or newer (``StashKey``,
new-style hook wrappers); older pytests fail to load it at the ``pytest11``
entry point.
