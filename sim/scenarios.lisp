;; inverter's sunlight%, a boiler's demand — to its PRE-SCENARIO
;; state, no matter what happened to that knob in between: the
;; scenario's own `drive` section, a `cue` re-driving it, or a manual
;; poke while the scenario was running. Simple and uniform — first
;; snapshot (taken the moment before a scenario first touches a
;; knob) wins, always — and it holds for EVERY door onto those
;; knobs: the Lisp setters, the UI/REPL through them, and the typed
;; `POST /api/component/:id/drive` route, which snapshots on exactly
;; the same first-touch rule. `scenario-stop` also cancels every
;; timer THIS scenario armed for itself — every `agent`
;; (`scenario--agent` -> `define-controller` -> `every`), every
;; `cue` / `expect` check timer (`scenario--at`), and any
;; `random-outage` chain started while it was running — via
;; `scenario--cancel-timers` below, so nothing is left running to
;; re-drive a knob (or flip a component's health) a heartbeat after
;; it's restored. Cancelling an outage chain MID-OUTAGE also puts
;; that victim's health back, since the timer that would have done
;; it is the one being cancelled.
;;
;; What teardown does NOT undo: health, modes and other state a
;; scenario wrote directly — a cue's own `set-component-health`, an
;; agent's setpoints, `set-battery-soc`, `set-boiler-pressure`.
;; Only knobs with a snapshot (the five above) and the outage chain's
;; own in-flight victim come back.
;;
;; Starting a scenario while another one is still running tears the
;; running one down FIRST — `scenario-start` itself does it, so it
;; holds however the new run was started — and the second run begins
;; from the first's pre-scenario state rather than inheriting its
;; displaced knobs and orphaned timers.

  :max-duration Outage duration upper bound.
  :kind         Health symbol while down (default 'error).

Each cycle picks a random id, schedules a `(set-component-health
ID KIND)` after a uniform-random gap, reverts to 'ok after a
uniform-random duration, and reschedules — so a single
`(random-outage ...)` call drives outages until something cancels
it: `reset-state`'s central `(cancel-timers)` always does, and — if
this call was made while a scenario was running (a `:setup` form, a
cue, or a REPL call mid-run) — so does that scenario's own
`(scenario-stop)`. An outage chain started OUTSIDE a running
scenario (bare REPL call, or a config's own top-level form) is
unaffected by any scenario's stop — only `reset-state` reaches it.

Ownership is decided ONCE, here, and latched on
`random-outage--scenario-owned` for the whole chain. It cannot be
re-derived per re-arm: a chain re-arms itself from its own timer
callbacks, so an AMBIENT chain that happens to re-arm while some
unrelated scenario is running would be adopted by that scenario
mid-flight and killed by its stop — an ambient chain outliving
every scenario is the whole point of the distinction.

Starting a chain also clears `random-outage--current-victim': the
new chain has nobody down yet, and whatever a previous chain left in
flight is not this one's to restore. Leaving it set would hand that
id to THIS chain's ownership — a scenario stop would then force
`(set-component-health OLD-ID 'ok)` and journal a \"back\" event for
an outage this chain never caused. The cost is that replacing a
chain mid-outage abandons the old victim: the previous chain's
pending restore timer, if it survives, now finds no victim and
no-ops (which also stops it double-scheduling onto the new chain)."

A no-op when the stop lands in the gap between outages, no victim
— which is the common case, so a scenario that never happened to be

restored: teardown puts back the knobs it snapshotted and the outage
it cancelled, not every write a scenario made.

  "Compile and start the scenario NAME: reset the journal, seed RNG,
run SETUP, install DRIVE sources + AGENTS controllers, schedule CUES
actions + EXPECT checks as timers, and open recording. Returns NAME.

Two runs cannot overlap, but this does not police that itself:
`scenario-start' below tears down a scenario that is still running
before it opens the new journal, so the guard covers a bare
`(scenario-start ...)' from a script or the REPL just as much as a
`define-scenario' run compiled here. By the time it returns, the
previous run's knobs are restored and its timers cancelled.

`scenario--armed-timers' is reset anyway, for the one case that
teardown cannot cover: a reload that cut a previous run off
mid-flight, leaving handles behind with no running scenario to
attribute them to. That reset must come AFTER `scenario-start',
never before — the teardown inside it cancels exactly the handles on
that list, so clearing it first would silently leave the previous
run's agents and cues firing. Timers armed from SETUP onward are
tracked automatically — `scenario-start' is what makes
`(scenario-running-p)' true, and `scenario--track-timer' reads
that."
