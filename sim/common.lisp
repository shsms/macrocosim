;; file's timers and leave every other file's animation running.

(defun cancel-timers ()
  "Cancel every timer tracked on `active-timers` (pushed by `every`,
`scenario-end-after`, and the random-outage chain). Process-wide —
REPL-armed timers included. A whole-world reload calls this
centrally before replaying the files, so scripts do NOT call it
themselves — a script's own call, replayed after another script,
would cancel that script's freshly re-registered timers.
Re-loading one file cancels only that file's timers, via
`cancel-file-timers`.

Also resets `scenario--armed-timers` and BOTH of the random-outage
chain's own variables — the `random-outage--scenario-owned`
ownership latch and the `random-outage--current-victim` in-flight
marker — to nil, if bound (only true once sim/scenarios.lisp has
been loaded).

Every handle the armed list might be holding was just cancelled
above (it's a subset of the same `active-timers` entries), so a
stale reference left there after a whole-world reload would be dead
weight. The chain those entries belonged to is gone too, in both of
its aspects: a NEXT chain must re-decide for itself whether a
scenario owns it rather than inheriting the cut-off run's answer,
and — the sharper one — a victim id left behind by a chain cancelled
MID-OUTAGE must not outlive it. `random-outage--release-victim`
reads that marker under the NEXT chain's ownership, so a stale id
would have a later scenario's stop force-write
`(set-component-health OLD-ID 'ok)` and journal a \"back\" event for
an outage that chain never caused. Clearing it here costs the
cut-off outage its restore — the timer that would have run it was
just cancelled anyway — and a reload rebuilds the world regardless.

Nothing else needs resetting: whether a timer armed after this point
belongs to a scenario is read from the journal at arm time
(`scenario-running-p`), so a reload landing mid-scenario cannot
leave a stale \"we are tracking\" flag behind to capture an ambient
timer."

:every-ms ms (default 100) on Config's refresh loop. A controller is the
closed-loop counterpart to the open-loop drivers — it *senses* live
state and *actuates* in response, modelling an EMS / dispatcher.

Inside :on-tick, read live state with `component-active-power`,
`component-bound-lower`, and `component-bound-upper` (the latter two
report the effective bounds, so they follow any cap a bounds-driving app
has applied), and actuate with `set-active-power` —
pass its CLAMP arg `t` to command \"as much as the live cap allows\"
without tracking the augmentations yourself. eg. a dispatcher that keeps
a battery inverter charging at the highest power the live cap allows:

  (define-controller :id 'ems
    :on-tick (lambda () (set-active-power 300 (component-bound-upper 300) 2000 t)))

The optional :id is a readability/label. The timer is tracked on
`active-timers` so `reset-state` cancels it on reload.

Cadence vs command-delay: each command takes :command-delay-ms to
execute, and while one executes only the newest incoming command waits
for its turn. A controller that re-sends every :every-ms therefore
trails the target by about one delay; re-sending faster than the delay
is safe (it never starves the device), it just wastes commands."
