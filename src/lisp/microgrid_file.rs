//! Text-format primitives for a managed microgrid `.lisp` file: a
//! switchyard-generated block (structure, rewritten on every save)
//! followed by a hand-written script section (loaded verbatim,
//! never touched by switchyard). `parse` / `compose` split and
//! rejoin the two; `rewrite_id` / `rewrite_grpc_port` /

//!
//! `render_block` / `render_empty_block` render the generated block
//! from live state, the inverse of `parse`. Between them these are
//! the whole read/write surface of the format: the loader
//! (`lisp::boot`) parses a file to decide how to evaluate it and
//! reads its head id back, the persist pass (`lisp::overrides`)
//! re-renders the block on every structural edit, undo / snapshots
//! swap blocks in and out, and the create / import / load-as
//! endpoints (`ui::handlers::microgrids`) compose and re-id whole
