//! Lisp glue: load the config DSL, register the `make-*` functions
//! against a `MicrogridSite`, and act as the runtime entry point for the gRPC
//! server (which calls into us for `set_active_setpoint` and friends).
//!
//! The `Config` struct is intentionally thin — the simulation state
//! lives in `MicrogridSite`, the lisp interpreter is just the configuration
//! frontend. Behaviour is fanned out across child modules:
//!
//! - `boot` — `Config::new`, the long-lived loops (lisp refresh,
//!   request-timeout sweep), the tags-table pass, hot-reload + watch.
//! - `overrides` — `eval` and the file regeneration it triggers.
//! - `snapshots` — `save_snapshot_for` / `load_snapshot_for` against
//!   a microgrid's own file.
//! - `undo` — the per-microgrid undo / redo stacks over managed
//!   microgrid files.
//! - `defuns` — every `ctx.defun(...)` installer the config DSL
//!   exposes.
