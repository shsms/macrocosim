//! Two orthogonal control-loop primitives shared by inverters, EV
//! chargers, anything else that does not respond instantly to a
//! set-point command.
//!
//! A real inverter takes some time to acknowledge a SCADA command (the

//! rate (the `Ramp`) — exceeding the slew rate would damage capacitors,
//! breakers, or the battery itself. Tests for both live next to the
//! implementations.
