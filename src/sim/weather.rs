//! Cloud cover comes from two producers that both just push

//! generator (driven by [`Weather::advance`], when
//! `cloud_rate_per_h` is configured) and a scripted door
//! ([`Weather::pass_cloud`]) for scenarios and the weather panel.
//! [`Weather::pct_at`] multiplies every event's transmission
