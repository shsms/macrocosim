//! Scenario lifecycle + reporting on a `MicrogridSite`.
//!
//! Three concerns live here:
//!
//! - The scenario journal: start / stop / record / events_since /
//!   summary / report, plus the elapsed-time accessor.
//! - CSV sink open / close — paired with scenario start / stop so
//!   the recorded files match the journal window.
//! - The scenario-report shape and its SoC-stats helper.
//!
//! All persistent state lives in `MicrogridSiteInner`; this file
//! only adds methods.
