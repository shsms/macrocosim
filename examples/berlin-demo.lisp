;;; switchyard:end
;; Berlin demo — a self-contained switchyard world: one microgrid
;; (id 2200) with battery, solar, EV-charger, CHP and consumer
;; branches, its environment animation, and the seven starter
;; scenarios that drive it.
;;
;; Run it as the boot script:
;;
;;   cargo run --bin switchyard examples/berlin-demo.lisp
;;
;; or load it into a bare engine (`cargo run --bin switchyard`) at
;; runtime, from the REPL box or the Microgrids tab:
;;
;;   (load "examples/berlin-demo.lisp")
;;
;; A relative path resolves against the state dir (--state-dir,
;; default: the directory the server was started from).
;;
;; Anything below is yours. It runs after the structure above, in
;; this microgrid's scope, on every load. Drive meters, define
;; scenarios, set setpoints here — do not construct components (the
;; generated block above owns the structure; constructing more here
;; collides on the next load).
;;
;; Component ids are pinned throughout. Auto ids come from an
;; enterprise-wide allocator, so they depend on what else loaded
;; first — and the scenarios below address components by id.

;; No timer hygiene needed here: loading a file that is already
;; loaded is treated as a reload — the file's own timers are
;; cancelled first, so each script's `every` blocks re-register
;; exactly once.

;; (σ / sqrt(2k) with σ = 0.015 Hz/√s and k = 0.05 /s), ~20-second
