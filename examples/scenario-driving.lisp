;; A 30-minute imperative demo scenario, driving the Berlin demo
;; world (load examples/berlin-demo.lisp first).
;;
;; Run from the REPL:
;;
;;   (load "examples/scenario-driving.lisp")
;;
;; The scenario starts on load and runs ONCE: a purely imperative
;; script registers no topology, so it is not replayed on reloads.
;; Watch progress in the UI's "Report" side panel, or curl the JSON
;; endpoints:

;; topology:

;;   id 100  hidden consumer meter (driven by its inline :power lambda)
;;   id 200  solar inverter

;; ── Lifecycle ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
(scenario-start "example-30min")

;; Cap the run at 30 wall-clock minutes; (scenario-stop) fires
;; automatically. It freezes elapsed + every metric accumulator AND
;; unwinds the run: every knob this script drove goes back to what it
;; was before the run first touched it. So the minute-15 sunlight
;; setting is itself reverted at minute 30 — inverter 200 returns to
;; berlin-demo.lisp's own sunlight source, not to the 100 % this
;; script last set — and the outage chain below, armed while the run
;; is in progress, is cancelled with the run. If minute 30 lands
;; inside one of that chain's outages (with the timings below, a
;; battery is down maybe a fifth of the time), teardown puts the
;; victim's health back as it cancels the chain, rather than leaving
;; it in 'error with no chain left to restore it.
;;
;; Health this script flips ITSELF is a different matter: teardown
;; restores driven knobs and the outage chain's victim, not every
;; write. A (set-component-health ...) in a cue of your own stands
;; after the stop until something puts it back.
;;
;; The bare `every` / `run-with-timer` blocks below are NOT the
;; scenario's own timers (only `agent` / `cue` / `expect` sections
;; and a `random-outage` chain are), so they keep firing afterward:
;; the consumer-load loop simply re-drives meter 100 a second after
;; teardown restored it. Cancel them with `(cancel-timers)` when
;; you want the world fully back to where it started.

;; profile: 5 kW base for the first 13 minutes of every 15-minute

;; classic "demand peak right before the billing window closes"
;; stress case.
