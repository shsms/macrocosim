// over one payload, but the module itself imports two browser-bound
// siblings (routing.js reaches the whole SPA graph). So rather than a
// DOM shim, the two import lines are swapped for local stubs and the
// internals under test are re-exported, and the result is imported as
// a data: URL. Nothing inside the functions is touched: this reads the
// real source, and a rename here fails loudly rather than silently
// testing a copy.
